## Overview

This blog preview card is a visual representation of a blog post designed for social media and other platforms. It typically includes a concise title, a featured image, a brief excerpt from the content, author information, the publication date, and a "Read More" link. The goal is to provide a snapshot of the blog post's essence, enticing users to click through for more information. These cards serve as effective marketing tools to attract attention and encourage engagement with the full blog post.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

My process involved creating an HTML structure that consists of a container element representing the blog card that holds another block element that contains a featured image along with multiple other elements that contain the content of the card. The CSS is used for styling the component with all of the necessary borders, colors, layouts, and typography choices needed to showcase this card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use box-shadows more effectively to create a good looking almost comic aesthetic

### Continued development

This card could end up becoming more customizable with compoentry within a framework to alter the colors, images, and more.
